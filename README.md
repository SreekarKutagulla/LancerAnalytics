# Lancer Analytics

## **This is a Saint Francis based club **

## Our Goal

Our goal is to provide a more intuitve approach to playing sports. We calculate sports data, analyze the data, and make predictions using computer models. Our data is aimed to increase the probabilty of winning for **Saint Francis** and to provide **coaches**, **offensive and defensive coordinators**, and **assistants** with *real time* data to make decisions about plays easier.


### Programming Languages

Our primary language for this club is **Python**. We plan to convert our code to **R** in the future to make running predictions much easier and faster. 

## Data

Our data is used from **Hudl**. We manually, or by computer vision, input data into certain excel sheets with the columns dependent on the sport. Multiple of these ```csv``` files are organized into **data** folders, where the appropriate sport folders contain the different parts of that sport. 


## Sports

Currently, we are analyzing and running prediction models for specifically football, basketball, and baseball. Future sports for consideration are tennis, water polo, and/or soccer.
